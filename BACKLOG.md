# HERETICS 40K — AGENT BACKLOG

**The single source of truth for who is building what.** Every agent reads this file
*first*, before touching anything else. The coordination rules that govern this board live
in `CLAUDE.md → Multi-Agent Coordination` — read them once per session.

- **Isolation model:** shared working folder, everyone commits to `main`. There is no
  structural wall — this board + the lane rule ARE the wall. Respect them.
- **Push is gated to Daak.** Agents never push. Mark a task `ready-to-push`; Daak pushes;
  then every agent re-syncs.
- **Session-link:** the `Owner` cell carries `sess:<uuid>`. Any agent can read a live
  session's work at `~/.claude/projects/-Users-daak-Projects-heretics-40k/<uuid>.jsonl`
  (`tail` it) to see what the owner is doing right now — without interrupting them.

## 🎯 PRIORITY FOCUS — MILESTONE A: PLAYABLE SOLO ALPHA

> **North Star:** a real player can go **title → NEW COMMANDER (Rites) → play → it saves →
> come back → CONTINUE** — a persistent single-player run on the live URL. Every task on this
> board is ranked by how directly it moves us to that. When you claim, prefer a higher tier.

**BUILD LAW — no tech debt, leverage what exists.** Every feature must **extend a system we
already shipped**, not bolt a parallel one beside it. Reuse the pure cores (`LOADOUT` /
`THREAD` / `WORLD`), the storage-adapter seam (`LocalStore`→`RemoteStore`), `doorCatalog`, the
galaxy readers (`fPl`/`fLoc`), the living-world tick. If a task tempts a shortcut that will
need unpicking later, stop and compose with the existing seam instead. Build so Stage-2
(backend/multiplayer) is a **drop-in at a seam**, never a rewrite.

**Already landed (the hard part of "log in & play"):**
```
✓ full-S profile persistence (localStorage serialize/hydrate)   85ee1a6
✓ title screen — CONTINUE + digest + first-run gating           9b2efb0
✓ Founding rite → spawns a REAL saved commander                 2e37b3b
✓ galaxy live at v1.13 (Solar + Pacificus minted)               G1 + G2
```

**Priority ladder to Milestone A** (claim top-down):

```
P0 · THE GATE — finish before "playable at all"
  └─ T-FD1 ✅ MERGED — full-S persistence · title/CONTINUE/digest · Founding onramp · Settings · demo+LS_NPC retired  (pushed 8a8f61d)

P1 · MAKES SOLO WORTH PLAYING — the world must respond to a lone player
  ├─ T-NPC-2b ✅ MERGED — enemy AI takes combat turns (fights back)
  ├─ galaxy G1–G5 ✅ MERGED (v1.16) · T-GX-G6 slice 1a ✅ RIFT core (v1.18)
  ├─ T-RIFT-1b  felt Rift penalties (travel/requisition ±25%) — shovel-ready on the RIFT core
  └─ T-TERR-1   territory persistence + per-sector production = THE FLYWHEEL (the "world
                accumulates" payoff). NB: G6's production bonus is blocked on THIS, not on galaxy authoring.

P2 · DEPTH & FEEL — elevate the loop, extend existing cores only
  ├─ T-THR-1   Speaker-attributed thread log (core to the play-by-post feel; presentation-only)
  ├─ T-BF4 / T-BF5   Combat depth (scout sight, deploy respec) — reuse Barracks/Armoury UI
  └─ T-BF3     Grid config → canon (tunable, zero debt)

DEFER · not blocking the alpha — don't over-invest, don't accrue debt
  └─ T-ENG-1/2/3 stubs (throne-room, trade escrow, pursuit) · art (wireframe → procedural/leverage, not asset-debt)
```

## Lane legend

A task's **lane** is the set of files it will touch. Overlapping lanes collide.

| Lane | Files | Contention |
|------|-------|-----------|
| 🔥 `engine` | `index.html` | **HOT — only ONE `in-progress` task may hold it at a time.** Others wait in `open`/`blocked`. |
| `canon` | `heretics-40k-data-v1.json` | Warm — coordinate; prefer one editor at a time. |
| `tests` | `tests/**` | Cool — parallel-safe. |
| `docs` | `docs/**`, `*.md`, `*.pdf` | Cool — parallel-safe. |

**Design tasks to avoid the 🔥 lane when you can** (JSON-only / tests-only / docs-only work
runs fully parallel). If two tasks both need `index.html`, they serialize — that is the point.

## Status legend

`open` → `claimed` → `in-progress` → `ready-to-push` → `merged` &nbsp;·&nbsp; plus `blocked`, `paused`

## BOARD

### 🔥 engine lane (index.html) — serialize: only one `in-progress` at a time

| ID | Task | Lane | Status | Owner · session | Updated | Notes |
|----|------|------|--------|-----------------|---------|-------|
| T-FD1 | **Front Door + persistence backbone** — title screen (`CONTINUE` + "while-you-were-away" digest · `NEW COMMANDER` · `SETTINGS`; plain-verb/grimdark skin, **demo retired**), **single active profile** save = full-`S` serialize/hydrate behind a **storage-adapter seam** (`LocalStore` now → `RemoteStore` drop-in later), Settings (AI · save mgmt · export/import · about), and wire the built-but-dead **Founding rite** → `commitFounding(cc)`. Unblocks live accumulation the living-world tick + galaxy both defer as "needs Stage-2 persistence". | 🔥 engine + tests + docs | `merged` | frontdoor · sess:ceba401d-bd17-42e8-ba28-878c120b9d89 | 2026-07-20 | ✅ DONE @ `008ba9b..6f013dc` (9 TDD tasks). **🔥 LANE RELEASED.** Full-`S` persistence + title (CONTINUE/NEW/SETTINGS) + digest-on-title + `commitFounding` onramp + Settings (export/import/delete) live; **demo retired**; **LS_NPC retired** (npcState rides profile). 133/133 tests; browser-verified end-to-end (found commander → play → reload persists; combat-thread+grid round-trips; 0 console errors). **Awaiting Daak push.** |
| T-BF4 | **Scout/aspect sight bonus** — `bfSetup` passes `0`; scan ability slots for scout/recon tag, pass `rules.grid.scout_sight_bonus` | 🔥 engine | `open` | — | — | Small once tag lookup settled; `Scout`/`Stealth` tags exist in GLOSS. |
| T-BF5 | **Deploy respec drill-in + freeze gating** — deploy tray opens model overview + Armoury equip; gate equip to `phase==='deploy'`, block on `state.locked` | 🔥 engine | `open` | — | — | Medium; reuses Barracks overview + Armoury flow. |
| T-BF2 | **Board from planet ⊕ location** — replace hardcoded `bfSetup` cfg with `bfBoardCfg(planetType,locationType,canon)` | 🔥 engine | `blocked` | — | — | **Blocked on T-GX galaxy accessors + `location_type.board` hint shape.** Safe default holds meanwhile. |
| T-NPC-2b | **NPC combat turn** — enemy AI picks moves+attacks via `reachable`/`spottedEnemies`/`bandOf`, stages a block, posts through `threadView`. Makes the enemy fight back. | 🔥 engine | `ready-to-push` | npcturn · sess:970009ad-d34c-4f64-9a2d-cd52fc53aac8 | 2026-07-20 | ✅ DONE · pure `THREAD.npcTurn` + `npcRespond` glue · 7 tests (incl. end-to-end apply: player takes damage, foe advances) · 143/143. **🔥 LANE RELEASED.** ⚠ live browser render UNVERIFIED (shared browser held all session) — needs a manual combat-thread pass. Awaiting Daak push. |
| T-THR-1 | **Speaker-attributed thread log** — a readable in-thread speech/thought convention so conversations (NPC↔PC, OC↔OC, multiple models of one PC) are legible about *who says what to whom* | 🔥 engine | `ready-to-push` | frontdoor · sess:ceba401d-bd17-42e8-ba28-878c120b9d89 | 2026-07-20 | ✅ DONE (4 tasks · 150/150 tests). **🔥 LANE RELEASED.** Full-identity speaker colours: per-model `speechColor` in S tints spoken `<b>` + name label + left-accent bar; `<i>`=dimmed thought; plain=narration. 8-swatch picker on model overview (owned-gated, persisted). Browser-verified: 3 distinct speakers in one thread, colour survives reload, 0 console errors. Awaiting Daak push. |
| T-ECO-1 | **Trade Haul missions — contract logistics (DESIGN LOCKED-ish, needs definition pass)** — a new Mission subtype: sub-faction **doors post contracts** asking Commanders for specific items in specific quantities; delivery pays **currency + Influence**. Faction-flavoured demands: Drukhari want living models as slave-stock, Votann want specific items, Astartes want weapons in bulk, Mechanicus wants tech/armour, etc. | 🔥 engine + canon + docs | `open` | — | — | **Daak decisions 2026-07-21:** ✅ (1) doors stock the RULING faction's arsenal — **SHIPPED** (`doorFactionId` via `pRuler`; conquest changes the shelves; contested ground = commons only). ✅ (4) provenance — items carry `origin` ("acquired at"); **gear battle records SHIPPED** (weapons count `kills`, armour counts `absorbed` — in `THREAD.apply`, shown on the entity card). ➡ (2) pivoted from freeform arbitrage to **contract hauls**: no open resale market; the DEMAND side is authored contracts at doors. **Still to define:** contract generation (per-door faction tables in canon `rules.trade.contracts`? tick-refreshed?), quantities/payout curve (currency + Influence; scale by distance from the requesting door to the goods' origin?), delivery UX (door panel "Fulfil contract" consuming matching `S.inv` items), the **slave-stock variant** (delivering living models — roster transfer, dark-fiction gating), and **relic contracts** riding the new battle records (e.g. "show a weapon with ≥3 confirmed kills of <subfaction> to NPC X"; needs per-subfaction kill attribution — currently kills are a flat count). (5) player↔player hauls ride Comms trade + escrow (T-ENG-2) at Stage 2. Output: spec in `docs/superpowers/specs/` + `rules.trade` canon shape, then an implementation slice. |
| T-ENG-1 | **Throne Room world-ender** resolution (acknowledges but doesn't resolve) | 🔥 engine | `open` | — | — | Stubbed; needs design pass. |
| T-ENG-2 | **Trade escrow / dispute→combat** — Comms trade transfers gear with no escrow | 🔥 engine | `open` | — | — | Stubbed; Stage-2-adjacent. |
| T-ENG-3 | **Grid-aware Exit pursuit** — replace flat `enemySpd=3` heuristic with position/speed-ranked rule | 🔥 engine | `open` | — | — | Low priority polish. |
| T-RIFT-1b | **Rift supply penalties — felt hooks (G6 slice 1b)** — apply the shipped `RIFT` core at existing seams so the Rift is felt in play | 🔥 engine | `ready-to-push` | terr · sess:f99107b3-ec8f-5a82-a770-4be40308d096 | 2026-07-21 | ✅ DONE · 183/183 tests · browser-verified (DG @ Vigilus: passage 120 → 90 home / 150 cross-Rift; shop 100 → 125 away; 0 engine JS errors). Pure `RIFT.applyTravel/applyReq` (+4 tests, `tests/rift-felt.test.js`); `riftStandingAt` resolves standing at any planet with **overlay-aware** sector owner (`secOwner`); travel passage ×travelMult at destination (preview + charge + ▼/▲ route marker); requisition ×reqMult at the door you stand at (shop/altar/reliquary display+cart, armoury Buy/Buy&Fit). Sell stays 60% of base — no away-side arbitrage. **G6 slice 1b complete**; §4.2 ruling trait + §4.3 garrison remain follow-on. **Paths:** `index.html`, `tests/rift-felt.test.js`, `BACKLOG.md`. Stacked on T-TERR-1 commits — push together. |
| T-TERR-1 | **Territory persistence + per-sector production (THE FLYWHEEL)** — save-state ownership of sectors/worlds so the living-world tick accrues by HOLDINGS, not a flat demo constant | 🔥 engine + canon | `ready-to-push` | terr · sess:f99107b3-ec8f-5a82-a770-4be40308d096 | 2026-07-21 | ✅ DONE (scope expanded per Daak: real thread resolution first) · canon **v1.19** · 179/179 tests · headless-browser-verified end-to-end (found → skirmish → annihilation resolution → INVASION conquest → 3-day tithe catch-up → reload persists; 0 engine JS errors). Ships: (A) `THREAD.outcome` + `concludeThread` + **live opposition muster** (startThread seeds your force vs local NPC faction detachment; `c.gen` persists via relink); (B) `S.world.rulers` overlay + `S.world.holdings` (crown-world seed + hydrate migration) + INVASION-victory CONQUEST; (C) `WORLD` per-holding production (`max(min, res×prod_mult÷divisor)` ×Rift home) + score drift + `sectorStatus` thresholds, digest itemized. **Paths:** `index.html`, `heretics-40k-data-v1.json`, `tests/thread-outcome.test.js`, `tests/world-territory.test.js`, `tests/canon.test.js`, `BACKLOG.md`. **Follow-ups:** seed `pos` at crown world (onramp still lands at Vigilus); RIFT standing vs overlay-owner; NPC reconquest pressure. |

### canon lane (heretics-40k-data-v1.json)

| ID | Task | Lane | Status | Owner · session | Updated | Notes |

Wireable-now hooks (travel/requisition ±25% via the core) = slice 1b; §4.2 ruling / §4.3 garrison = follow-on. |

### canon + tests lane — galaxy authoring (parallel-safe per segmentum)

## Log formatting convention (spec for T-THR-1)

The thread log needs to make **dialogue and inner life legible** — who is speaking, to
whom, and what a model is thinking — across NPC↔PC talk, two OCs, or several models of one
Commander in the same thread.

**The three signals:**

```
● **bold**      = SPOKEN WORD — anything said aloud: conversation, monologue, a shout,
                   a hail. If a model's mouth is making it, it's bold.
● *italics*     = INTERNAL THOUGHT — inner monologue, what a model (NPC or PC) is thinking
                   but not saying. Never heard by others in-fiction.
● speech COLOR  = SPEAKER IDENTITY — every model that can speak picks a colour on its
                   **model overview**; that colour tints its spoken (bold) lines so a
                   multi-speaker exchange is instantly attributable to the right mouth.
```

**Implementation shape (for whoever claims it):**
- **Colour is per-model instance state** (save-state `S`, not canon) — a `speechColor`
  field set from the model-overview overlay (a small swatch/picker next to the name).
  Default: assign a distinct colour per model on first speak, editable by the player.
- **Model overview:** add the colour picker; gate to models the player owns (NPC colours
  are authored/assigned server-side later — Stage 2/3).
- **Thread renderer:** when rendering a post, colourise `**bold**` runs with the speaking
  model's `speechColor`; leave `*italics*` in a neutral "thought" style (dimmed/muted, not
  colourised — thought has no audience). Plain text = narration/action, unstyled.
- **Attribution:** a post is authored by a Commander, but a single post may voice several
  of their models — so colour resolves per **speaker**, not per post. Consider a lightweight
  inline speaker tag (e.g. the model's colour swatch + name) when a post switches speakers.
- Keep it inside the existing `threadView` render path; no THREAD-core rule change needed
  (this is presentation, not state). Verify 0 console errors + a multi-speaker sample thread.
